# Processing documents with visual elements and image-based

Visual elements: pictures, charts
Image-based: pdf that are scanned image
Others: tables (especially merged cells)

My goal now is to create a quick and dirty solution.

My goal in the future:
- create a web app for processing only
- the ai container app will be for handling chat requests only
